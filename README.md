# Codedeck

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Sherlouk/Codedeck/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Sherlouk/Codedeck?branch=master)

A Swift library for interfacing with an Elgato StreamDeck.

## Work in Progress

I'm building this project in the open but I have next to no experience with this type of work. Happy to take advice as I learn!

The project is currently not setup in a usable fashion, and is very incomplete - this will improve over time.
